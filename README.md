# GRAIL-V CVPR 2026 Workshop Site

This site is built with Jekyll for easy content editing.

Quick edits
- Update section copy and lists in `_data/*.yml`.
- Update layout/structure in `_includes/sections/*.html`.
- Global structure lives in `_layouts/default.html`.
- Speaker/organizer photos go in `assets/people/` and are referenced from `_data/speakers.yml` and `_data/organizers.yml`.
