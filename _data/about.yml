eyebrow: "Why now"
title: "Grounded evidence is the missing piece for agentic vision"
paragraphs:
  - "Agentic vision systems now plan multi-step workflows, retrieve evidence from complex sources, rerank candidates, and verify before acting. Yet shared protocols for grounded retrieval and verification are fragmented across CV, IR, NLP, HCI, and systems."
  - "GRAIL-V brings the community together to define reproducible evaluation, reliable grounding, and efficiency metrics that matter in deployment: latency, memory, energy, and cost. We focus on evidence that is linked to regions, pages, and moments, not just documents."
