eyebrow: "Why now"
title: "Grounded evidence is the missing piece for agentic vision"
paragraphs:
  - "Vision-language agents increasingly rely on a loop of plan, retrieve, rerank, and verify before acting. But how we measure evidence grounding, calibration, and end-to-end efficiency is still fragmented across communities."
  - "GRAIL-V brings together CV, IR, NLP, HCI, and systems researchers to share evaluation practices and push toward deployable, accountable agentic vision systems with region/page/moment-level evidence."
