title: "Submit to GRAIL-V at CVPR 2026"
lead: "We invite archival papers and demos on grounded multimodal retrieval, reranking, and verification for agentic vision systems. We especially welcome work that reports grounded evidence (region/page/moment), calibration or abstention behavior, and real deployment constraints (latency, memory, cost)."
checklist:
  - "Format: CVPR template, up to 8 pages (references excluded)."
  - "Review: double-blind on OpenReview with 3 reviews + AC oversight."
  - "Evaluation: grounded provenance, calibration/abstention, and efficiency metrics."
  - "Artifacts: code/data/models encouraged with licenses and provenance."
paper_types:
  - title: "Archival paper"
